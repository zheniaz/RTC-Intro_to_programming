# Write a program that creates a dictionary containing the U.S. states as keys, and their capitals as values.
# (Use the Internet to get a list of the states and their capitals.)
# The program should then randomly quiz the user by displaying the name of a state and asking the user to enter that state‚Äôs capital.
# The program should keep a count of the number of correct and incorrect responses.
# (As an alternative to the U.S. states, the program can use the names of countries and their capitals.)
